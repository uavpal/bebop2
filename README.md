# Parrot Bebop 2 over 4G/LTE (softmod)

## About
BebopTwo4G is a software modification (softmod) for the Parrot Bebop 2 drone. Instead of the built-in regular Wi-Fi, it allows to use a 4G/LTE cellular/mobile network connection to link Skycontroller 2 to the Bebop 2. Control/telemetry and live video stream are routed through the 4G/LTE connection. In other words, range limit becomes your imagination! Ok, to be fair, it's still limited by the battery capacity :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

![BebopTwo4G softmod](http://uavpal.com/img/beboptwo4glte.jpg)

Pros:
- Range limit is no longer dependent on Wi-Fi signal
- Low hardware cost (around US$ 40.-)
- All stock hardware can be used (standard Parrot Skycontroller 2 with FreeFlight Pro App)
- Return-to-home (RTH) is auto-initiated in case of connection loss
- Allows independent real-time GPS tracking via [Glympse](https://www.glympse.com/get-glympse-app/)
- Easy initiation of 4G/LTE connection via Skycontroller 2 button
- Can be used for manually controlled flights as well as flight plans
- :boom: Videos and photos can be recorded to a [microSD card inside the 4G modem](#sdcard)

Cons:
- Dependent on [4G/LTE mobile network coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_4G_LTE_penetration) 
- Might incur mobile data cost (dependent on your mobile network operator)
- [Slightly higher latency](https://uavpal.com/bebop2/faq#latency) as compared to Wi-Fi

## Community
[![UAVPAL Slack Workspace](https://uavpal.com/img/slack.png)](https://uavpal.com/slack)

Instructions too technical? Having trouble installing the softmod? Questions on what hardware to order? Want to meet the developers? Interested in other mods (batteries, LEDs, etc.)? Interested to meet like-minded people? Having a great idea and want to let us know?\
We have a great and very active community on Slack, come [join us](https://uavpal.com/slack)!

## Why?
- The Parrot Bebop 2's stock Wi-Fi loses video signal way before the specified 2 km.
- Because we can :grin:

## How does it work?
![High-level connection diagram](https://uavpal.com/img/beboptwo4g_highlevel_diagram_end2end_v2.png)

In simple terms, the Wi-Fi connection is hijacked and routed via a tethering device (e.g. mobile phone) through a 4G/LTE cellular/mobile network to the Bebop 2. As tethering device, any modern mobile phone can be used (iOS: "Personal Hotspot" or Android: "Portable WLAN hotspot").
The Bebop 2 requires a 4G/LTE USB modem to be able to send and receive data via cellular/mobile networks.

![USB Modem plugged into Bebop 2](https://uavpal.com/img/beboptwo4g-yellow2.jpg)

Initiation of the 4G/LTE connection (and switch back to Wi-Fi) can be done by simply pressing the Settings button twice on Skycontroller 2.

![Settings Button on Skycontroller 2](https://image.ibb.co/iBWcgn/settingsbutton.jpg)

The "Power" LED on Skycontroller 2 will change to solid blue once the 4G/LTE connection to the Bebop 2 is established.

[![Skycontroller 2 with blue LED](https://image.ibb.co/f5Uz97/SC2_small_blue.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEz70ClCetM)

Once up in the air, everything works in the same manner as with the stock Wi-Fi connection, e.g. flight plans, return-to-home (auto-initiated in case of connection loss), etc.

The mobile device running FreeFlight Pro (the one connected to Skycontroller 2 via USB) can even be the same as the mobile tethering device/phone.

[ZeroTier](https://zerotier.com) is a free online service, which we use to manage and encrypt the connection between the Bebop 2 and Skycontroller 2. ZeroTier will find the fastest and shortest connection (e.g. by doing NAT traversal) to give you the best possible performance, regardless of the mobile operator's network topology.

Additionally, [Glympse](https://www.glympse.com/get-glympse-app/), a free App for iOS/Android, allows independent real-time GPS tracking and shows [detailed telemetry data](https://uavpal.com/bebop2/faq#whyglympse) (signal strength, altitude, speed, compass, battery and latency) of the Bebop 2 via 4G/LTE. This can be particularly useful to recover the Bebop 2 in the unfortunate event of a crash or flyaway.

![Glympse App showing Bebop 2's location](https://uavpal.com/img/glympse_bebop2.jpg)

<a name="sdcard">The latest (optional) feature of our softmod is the video and photo recording to a microSD card inside the 4G modem.
![E3372h 4G USB modem with microSD card](https://uavpal.com/img/E3372_microSD.png)

This gives you
- More storage space available than the built-in 32 GB: great for longer flights or multiple flights where videos cannot be transferred to a PC immediately.
- No more long transfer time required from the Bebop 2 to a PC (usually done via USB cable or Wi-Fi).
- Saves battery power (and reduces charging cycles long-term) as videos don't have to be transferred on a battery-powered CHUCK.
- The microSD card can be unplugged after the flight and plugged into a PC - the pilot can watch the video immediately without having to transfer anything first.
